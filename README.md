# Generating with Text: Text as Input

## Instructor: [Hannah Davis](https://www.hannahishere.com)


## Description: 

In this class, we'll look at unique ways to create generative projects with text, including extracting sentiment from text and using text to generate audio. We'll look at how to use standard tools like the NLTK as well as other APIs. We'll also talk about creating/curating text datasets and about the idea of "subjective datasets," and what that means for our practice. 


## Outline:

We'll start with a roughly 30 minute lecture. We'll talk in general about emotional data & sentiment analysis, data sonification (representing data through sound), and subjective datasets. I will show my work on using the texts of novels, debates, news articles, and country constitutions as inputs to generate music.

We'll use the remaining class time to create a Twitter bot bringing together everything we've learned, and go over the pipeline from setup to hosting.
